# Scripts

Over the years, I have accumulated some scripts that made my life a bit easier. The creation of this repository is dual purpose: to eliminate the constant backups on servers (even though they are automated) and share some of them with the community.

### In this repository
you will find scripts that run on various platforms. I kept the super personal scripts out of this, and have tried to generalize them. Some examples are Ubuntu server/desktop, Windows, Python, etc. but they are all works in progress.
